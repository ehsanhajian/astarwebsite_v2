      "As promised during our latest community AMA, we want to give you an overview of the roadmap for the Astar ecosystem. Most of you already know that the Astar ecosystem contains two main networks: Shiden connected as a parachain on Kusama and Astar connected as a parachain on Polkadot.",

Americans now have the freedom to purchase, trade, or hold the most popular blockchain asset in Japan (according to a survey by Japan Blockchain Association).",

    description:
      "We are constructing a multichain network that not only allows developers to build smart contracts in either Solidity or ink!, but encourages developers to build across and between EVM and WASM. The first step was to bootstrap Astar Network by creating an ecosystem of dApps built with already successful smart contracts found on other chains, yet we do not believe this is the entire solution for the long-term success of Astar or Polkadot.",

    description:
      "Throughout the history of blockchains, interoperability and multi-chain applications are considered the holy grails of Web 3.0. With the Polkadot ecosystem of parachains and cross-consensus messaging (XCM), not only do we have multi-chain assets, but we can also leverage functional interoperability. At Astar Network, we believe that this is the key to creating the next generation of innovative dApps and further progressing Web3.0.",
